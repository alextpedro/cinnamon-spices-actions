# Run in Terminal Cinnamon Action

Right-click a .sh file and run in terminal, spawning a new terminal window which immediately runs your script. 

## Installing / Getting started

From Cinnamon Spices Website:
> Download the zip file from the top right

From Cinnamon Actions settings menu: 
> Go to the Download tab
> Search "run in terminal" without quotes
> Click the install button (downward-pointing arrow)

From GitHub:
> Go to the releases page
> Download the latest release zip file
> Uncompress it into ~/.local/share/nemo/actions

When you right-click a .sh script file you should have a new menu action, Run in Terminal.

## Features

It runs a script file in a new terminal window. Because I am lazy that way.

Special thanks to all other Actions developers, it was much easier to see what you all did than parse through the sample file <3
